4. Run tests to verify setup:
   ```bash
   npm test
   ```

## Development Process

### Branching

- Create a feature branch from `main`:
  ```bash
  git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
  ```
- Use descriptive branch names:
  - `feature/` for new features
  - `fix/` for bug fixes
  - `docs/` for documentation updates
  - `refactor/` for code refactoring
  - `test/` for test improvements

### Commit Messages

```

**Types:**
- `feat:` - New feature
- `fix:` - Bug fix
- `docs:` - Documentation changes
- `test:` - Adding or updating tests
- `refactor:` - Code refactoring

5. Run smoke tests: `npm run smoke`

## Pull Request Process

1. **Update Documentation**: Ensure README and relevant docs reflect your changes
2. **Add Tests**: New features must include tests
3. **Pass All Tests**: Verify `npm test` passes locally
4. **Update CHANGELOG**: Add entry for your changes (if applicable)
5. **Create Pull Request**:
   - Use a clear, descriptive title
   - Reference any related issues
   - Describe what changed and why
   - Include testing steps

## Coding Standards

### Style Guide

- Use ES6+ JavaScript features
- Use 2-space indentation
- Use descriptive variable and function names
- Add comments for complex logic
- Keep functions focused and small

### File Structure

```
src/
â”œâ”€â”€ cli.js              # CLI entry point
â”œâ”€â”€ core/               # Core utilities
â”œâ”€â”€ publishers/         # Store-specific publishers
â””â”€â”€ utils/              # Shared utilities
```

### Error Handling

- Use custom error classes from `src/core/errors.js`
- Always sanitize PII from error messages
- Include context in error messages

### Testing

- Write unit tests for all new code
- Place tests in `test/unit/` directory
- Use descriptive test names
- Mock external dependencies

## Testing

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run tests in watch mode
npm test -- --watch

# Run specific test file
npm test -- test/unit/publishers/chrome.test.js

# Run smoke tests
npm run smoke
```

### Writing Tests

Example test structure:

```javascript
import { describe, it, expect, beforeEach, afterEach, vi } from 'vitest';
import { ChromePublisher } from '../../../src/publishers/chrome.js';

describe('ChromePublisher', () => {
  let publisher;

  beforeEach(() => {
    publisher = new ChromePublisher({
      publisherId: 'test',
      itemId: 'test-item',
      wifConfig: {}
    });
  });

  it('should validate manifest successfully', async () => {
    const result = await publisher.validate('/path/to/manifest.json');
    expect(result).toBe(true);
  });
});
```
