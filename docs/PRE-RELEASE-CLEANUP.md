## 🚨 CRITICAL Issues (Must Fix Before Public)

### 1. Package.json - Missing Dependencies

**Issue**: Package.json missing runtime dependencies

**Current State**:
```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "@octokit/rest": "^22.0.0",
    "commander": "^11.1.0"
  }
}
```

**Missing**:
- `google-auth-library@^9.0.0` (Chrome WIF authentication)
- `archiver@^6.0.0` (Packaging .zip files)
- `web-ext@^7.9.0` (Firefox manifest validation)

**Impact**: Users running `npm install @littlebearapps/gatekeeper` will get runtime errors

**Fix**:
```bash
npm install --save google-auth-library@^9.0.0 archiver@^6.0.0 web-ext@^7.9.0
```

**Additional package.json updates needed**:
```json
{
  "license": "MIT",  // Change from "UNLICENSED"
  "repository": {
    "type": "git",
    "url": "https://github.com/littlebearapps/gatekeeper.git"
  },
  "bugs": {
    "url": "https://github.com/littlebearapps/gatekeeper/issues"
  },
  "homepage": "https://github.com/littlebearapps/gatekeeper#readme",
  "engines": {
    "node": ">=18.0.0"
  },
  "keywords": [
    "browser-extensions",
    "chrome-extension",
    "firefox-addon",
    "publishing",
    "automation",
    "github-actions",
    "chrome-web-store",
    "firefox-amo",
    "microsoft-edge"
  ]
}
```

---

### 2. Missing LICENSE File

**Issue**: Repository has no LICENSE file

**Current State**: package.json says `"license": "UNLICENSED"`

**Impact**:
- Legal risk for users (unclear usage rights)
- npm may reject package
- GitHub shows "No license" warning
- Can't be used in commercial projects

**Fix**: Create `LICENSE` file with MIT License text

**Content**:
```

### 3. Internal Development Artifacts

**Issue**: Repository contains local development files not meant for public

**Files to DELETE**:
```bash
# macOS metadata
.DS_Store
docs/.DS_Store

# Local MCP server configurations
.mcp.json
.mcp.lean.json
.mcp.full.json
.mcp.research.json

# Claude Code local settings
.claude/settings.local.json

# Internal development documentation
CLAUDE.md           # Development instructions for Nathan
AGENTS.md           # Codex/GPT-5 coordination notes
```

**Impact**:
- Exposes local development workflow (confusing for public)
- `.DS_Store` files are macOS junk (unprofessional)
- `.mcp.json` files reveal local tooling setup
- `CLAUDE.md` references internal structure

**Removal Script**:
```bash
cd ~/claude-code-tools/lba/infrastructure/gatekeeper/main

# Remove files
rm .DS_Store docs/.DS_Store
rm .mcp.json .mcp.lean.json .mcp.full.json .mcp.research.json
rm -rf .claude/
rm CLAUDE.md AGENTS.md

# Stage deletion
git add -A
git commit -m "chore: remove internal development artifacts before public release"
```

---

### 4. README.md - Too Internal

**Issue**: Current README references internal tools and concepts

**Current Problems**:
- References "CloakPipe" and "Homeostat" (internal tools)
- Shows "Phase 1, 2, 5" status (internal planning)
- Contains local file paths
- Status shows "Ready for Phase 1" (confusing)
- Target extensions are specific to LBA

**Impact**: Public users won't understand internal terminology

**Fix**: Complete rewrite for public audience (see README Rewrite section below)

---

### 5. .gitignore Inadequate

**Issue**: Current .gitignore only has:
```
node_modules/
.DS_Store
```

**Missing**:
- Editor configurations (.vscode, .idea, *.swp)
- Environment files (.env, .env.local, .env.*)
- Log files (*.log, npm-debug.log*)
- Build artifacts (dist/, build/)
- Test coverage (coverage/)
- OS files (Thumbs.db, Desktop.ini)

**Fix**: See .gitignore Update section below

---

## 📋 Files Cleanup Strategy (Option B)

### ❌ MUST DELETE

**Reason**: Internal development artifacts, not useful for public

```bash
# macOS junk
.DS_Store
docs/.DS_Store

# Local development configs
.mcp.json
.mcp.lean.json
.mcp.full.json
.mcp.research.json
.claude/settings.local.json

# Internal development docs
CLAUDE.md
AGENTS.md
```

**Deletion Script**:
```bash
rm .DS_Store docs/.DS_Store
rm .mcp*.json
rm -rf .claude/
rm CLAUDE.md AGENTS.md
```

---

### 🔄 KEEP (But Review Content)

**Reason**: Interesting for AI enthusiasts, educational value

```bash
# AI-assisted development artifacts (Option B strategy)
docs/codex/                              # 11 Codex prompts
docs/GATEKEEPER-IMPLEMENTATION-PLAN.md   # Comprehensive planning doc
docs/PHASE-3-INSTRUCTIONS.md             # Integration guide
```

**Rationale**:
- Shows AI-assisted development process (transparent)
- Educational for developers interested in Codex/GPT-5 workflows
- Demonstrates thorough planning (positive signal)
- Can be valuable reference for contributors

**Modifications Needed**:
1. Add disclaimer at top of each Codex file: "Historical artifact from development"
2. Create `docs/AI-WORKFLOW.md` explaining the Codex approach
3. Move to `docs/development/` subdirectory to signal internal nature

**Alternative**: If these feel too internal later, can delete post-launch

---

### ✅ KEEP (Production Code)

**Reason**: Required for package functionality

```bash
# Source code
src/                    # All production code
test/                   # Test suite
scripts/                # Utility scripts
.github/workflows/      # CI/CD workflows

# Standard files
package.json           # After fixing
package-lock.json
README.md              # After rewriting
.gitignore             # After updating

# Public documentation
docs/ (after organization)
```

---

### 🆕 ADD (Missing Standard Files)

**Reason**: Expected in public open-source projects

```bash
# Legal/License
LICENSE                 # MIT License text

# Security
SECURITY.md            # Vulnerability disclosure policy

# Community

1. Register app in Azure AD
2. Get Client ID and Client Secret
3. Get Product ID from Edge Partner Center

See [Configuration Guide](docs/CONFIGURATION.md) for detailed setup instructions.

## Error Handling

Gatekeeper automatically creates GitHub issues when publishing fails, enabling automated error tracking and fixes.

**Error Types**:
- `ValidationError`: Manifest validation failed
- `AuthenticationError`: Store credentials invalid
- `QuotaExceededError`: API rate limit hit
- `NetworkError`: Network connectivity issues
- `PackagingError`: Extension packaging failed

## Architecture

Gatekeeper uses a publisher pattern with store-specific implementations:

```
src/
├── publishers/
│   ├── base.js        # Abstract base publisher
│   ├── chrome.js      # Chrome Web Store publisher
│   ├── firefox.js     # Firefox AMO publisher
│   └── edge.js        # Microsoft Edge publisher
├── core/
│   ├── config.js      # Configuration validation
│   ├── errors.js      # Error taxonomy
│   └── logger.js      # Structured logging
└── utils/
    ├── retry.js       # Retry logic with backoff
    └── sanitize.js    # PII sanitization
```

## Development

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run tests
npm test

# Run smoke tests
npm run smoke

# Build package
npm pack
```

## Testing

Gatekeeper has 79 unit tests covering all publishers and core functionality:

```bash
npm test
```

Tests use mocked store APIs for safety and speed.

## Security

- ✅ **Zero Hardcoded Secrets**: All credentials via environment variables
- ✅ **PII Sanitization**: Automatic removal of sensitive data from logs
- ✅ **Dependency Auditing**: Regular `npm audit` runs
- ✅ **Input Validation**: All user input validated
- ✅ **Error Boundaries**: No uncaught exceptions

See [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) for vulnerability disclosure policy.

## Privacy

**Zero Data Collection**: Gatekeeper does not collect, store, or transmit any user data except what's required for browser store API operations.

All data sent to browser stores is:
- Required by store APIs (manifest, extension files)
- Sent directly to store APIs (no intermediaries)
- Controlled by you (your credentials, your data)

See [PRIVACY.md](PRIVACY.md) for details.

## Contributing

Contributions welcome! Please see [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for guidelines.

**Current Focus**:
- Safari App Store support (v0.2.0)
- Improved error messages
- More granular publish options

## Versioning

Gatekeeper follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/):
- **0.x.y**: Pre-1.0, breaking changes may occur between minor versions
- **1.x.y**: Stable API, breaking changes only in major versions

See [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) for version history.

### Action 6: Organize Documentation (30 minutes)

**Option B Strategy**: Keep AI artifacts but organize them clearly

**Create `docs/AI-WORKFLOW.md`**:
```markdown
# AI-Assisted Development Workflow

This document explains how Gatekeeper was developed using AI assistance (Codex and GPT-5).

## Overview

Gatekeeper was built using a hybrid approach:
- **Planning**: GPT-5 (o1) for deep analysis and implementation planning
- **Coding**: Codex (o3-mini) for code generation based on detailed prompts
- **Testing**: Claude Code (Sonnet) for integration and testing

## Artifacts in This Repository

### Implementation Plan
- `GATEKEEPER-IMPLEMENTATION-PLAN.md` - Comprehensive 3,776-line plan validated by GPT-5
- Contains architecture, security analysis, API specifications, and phase breakdowns

### Codex Prompts
The `codex/` directory contains 11 prompts used to generate the codebase:
- Prompts 01-08: Core functionality (publishers, utilities, CLI, monitoring)
- Prompt 09: GitHub Actions workflows and documentation
- Phase 3 prompt: Extension integration

Each prompt is optimized for token efficiency while maintaining completeness.

### Phase Instructions
- `PHASE-3-INSTRUCTIONS.md` - Step-by-step guide for integrating into extensions

## Why Keep These?

**Educational Value**:
- Shows realistic AI-assisted development workflow
- Demonstrates how to structure prompts for code generation
- Provides template for others building similar tools

**Transparency**:
- Shows thorough planning before coding
- Demonstrates security-first approach
- Reveals development process (authenticity)

**Reference**:
- Useful for understanding architectural decisions
- Helps contributors understand intent
- Documents why things were built a certain way

## For Contributors

If you're contributing to Gatekeeper, these documents can help you understand:
- Why certain patterns were chosen
- What security considerations were made
- How the architecture is intended to scale
- What was considered but not yet implemented

However, **the actual code is the source of truth**. These are historical artifacts.
```

**Move Files**:
```bash
mkdir -p docs/development
mv docs/codex docs/development/
mv docs/GATEKEEPER-IMPLEMENTATION-PLAN.md docs/development/
mv docs/PHASE-3-INSTRUCTIONS.md docs/development/
```

**Create `docs/development/README.md`**:
```markdown
# Development Documentation

**Note**: These are historical artifacts from the development process, preserved for transparency and educational purposes.

## Contents

### Implementation Planning
- **GATEKEEPER-IMPLEMENTATION-PLAN.md** - Comprehensive implementation plan (GPT-5 validated)
  - 3,776 lines covering architecture, security, APIs, phases
  - Used to guide development and validate approach

### AI-Assisted Code Generation
- **codex/** - Codex prompts used to generate codebase
  - 11 prompts covering all features
  - Token-optimized for efficient code generation
  - Shows AI-assisted development workflow

### Integration Guides
- **PHASE-3-INSTRUCTIONS.md** - Guide for integrating into browser extensions
  - Step-by-step instructions
  - Configuration examples
  - Testing procedures

## Purpose

These documents show:
- Thorough planning before coding
- Security-first approach
- AI-assisted development process
- Architectural decision rationale

## For Contributors

While interesting for context, **the actual code is the source of truth**. These are snapshots of the development process, not current documentation.

For current documentation, see:
- Main README.md
- docs/CONFIGURATION.md (to be created)
- docs/ARCHITECTURE.md (to be created)
- In-code JSDoc comments
```

**Commit**:
```bash
git add docs/AI-WORKFLOW.md docs/development/
git commit -m "docs: reorganize development artifacts for transparency

- Move Codex prompts to docs/development/codex/
- Move implementation plan to docs/development/
- Move phase instructions to docs/development/
- Add AI-WORKFLOW.md explaining AI-assisted development
- Add docs/development/README.md with context

These artifacts show the development process and are kept
for educational/transparency purposes, while clearly marking
them as historical rather than current documentation."
```

  - Low: Next release

### Disclosure Policy

- Please allow us reasonable time to fix the issue before public disclosure
- We will credit you in the fix (unless you prefer to remain anonymous)
- We will publish security advisories for confirmed vulnerabilities

## Security Best Practices

When using Gatekeeper:

### Credentials Management
- ✅ Store credentials in GitHub Secrets (encrypted)
- ✅ Use short-lived tokens when possible
- ✅ Rotate credentials regularly
- ❌ Never commit credentials to code
- ❌ Never log credentials

### API Keys
- ✅ Use minimum required permissions
- ✅ Monitor API usage for anomalies
- ✅ Revoke unused keys
- ❌ Don't share API keys between extensions

### GitHub Actions
- ✅ Use pinned workflow versions (@main for stable)
- ✅ Enable secret scanning
- ✅ Review workflow logs for leaks
- ❌ Don't use workflows from untrusted sources

## Known Limitations

### Not Designed For
- **Mass Publishing**: No bulk/automated publishing of multiple extensions
- **Anonymous Publishing**: Requires valid store credentials
- **Offline Use**: Requires internet connection for store APIs

### Security Boundaries
- **Credentials**: Stored in GitHub Secrets, not in Gatekeeper code
- **Extension Files**: Handled locally, not sent to third parties
- **Store APIs**: Direct communication (no proxies/intermediaries)

## Dependency Security

We monitor dependencies for known vulnerabilities:
- `npm audit` runs in CI
- Dependabot enabled for automated updates
- Regular manual reviews

## Contact

For security concerns: security@littlebearapps.com
For general issues: https://github.com/littlebearapps/gatekeeper/issues
```

**Commit**:
```bash
git add SECURITY.md
git commit -m "docs: add security policy and vulnerability disclosure process

- Define supported versions
- Provide vulnerability reporting process
- Set response timeline expectations
- Document security best practices for users
- Clarify known limitations
- Add dependency security monitoring info"
```

## 🧪 Testing Phase (30 Minutes)

### Action 11: Test npm Package Locally

**Create test script**:
```bash
cd ~/claude-code-tools/lba/infrastructure/gatekeeper/main

# Build tarball
npm pack

# Expected output: littlebearapps-gatekeeper-0.1.0.tgz
```

**Test in isolated environment**:
```bash
# Create test directory
mkdir -p /tmp/gatekeeper-test
cd /tmp/gatekeeper-test

# Install from tarball
npm install ~/claude-code-tools/lba/infrastructure/gatekeeper/main/littlebearapps-gatekeeper-0.1.0.tgz

# Test CLI
npx gatekeeper --help
# Should show help text

# Test imports
node -e "const gk = require('@littlebearapps/gatekeeper'); console.log(Object.keys(gk));"
# Should show: [ 'ChromePublisher', 'FirefoxPublisher', ... ]

# Cleanup
cd ~
rm -rf /tmp/gatekeeper-test
```

**If tests fail**: Fix issues, commit, rebuild

**If tests pass**: Ready for npm publish

---

## 🚀 Launch Strategy (Option B: Quiet Launch)

### Phase 1: Make Public (Day 1)

**Step 1: Make GitHub Repository Public**
```bash
gh repo edit littlebearapps/gatekeeper --visibility public
```

**Step 2: Verify Public Visibility**
```bash
# Open in browser
open https://github.com/littlebearapps/gatekeeper

# Should be accessible without authentication
```

**Step 3: Add GitHub Topics**
```bash
gh repo edit littlebearapps/gatekeeper --add-topic browser-extensions \
  --add-topic chrome-extension \
  --add-topic firefox-addon \
  --add-topic publishing \
  --add-topic automation \
  --add-topic github-actions \
  --add-topic nodejs \
  --add-topic deployment \
  --add-topic cicd
```
